## Video 2: Shopper - Your First Shopping Trip (5 min)

**[INTRO - 20 sec]**
"Welcome to the Tulemar Shop shopper team! You're about to become someone's personal shopper. Let me show you exactly how it works."

**[SCENE 1: Dashboard Overview - 40 sec]**
"This is your shopper dashboard. At the top, you see your daily earnings and stats. The 'Available Orders' section shows orders waiting to be claimed. The 'My Orders' section shows what you're currently shopping. Let's accept an order!"

**[SCENE 2: Accepting Orders - 45 sec]**
"Review the available orders. You'll see how many items, the total value, and any special notes. Click 'Accept Order' when you find one you want. Great! Now click 'Start Shopping' to begin. The timer starts now, so let's be efficient."

**[SCENE 3: Shopping Items - 90 sec]**
"Here's your shopping list. I like to scan through it first and plan my route. Start with produce, then move through the store systematically. For each item: find it, check the quality - no bruises on produce, furthest expiration date on dairy and meat, no damaged packaging. Tap the item and mark it 'Found' with the correct quantity. See this green checkmark? That means it's in your cart."

**[SCENE 4: Substitutions - 60 sec]**
"Uh oh, this item is out of stock. Tap it and select 'Not Found'. Now the app asks if you want to suggest a substitution. Find a similar item, take a clear photo showing the product and price, add a quick note, and send it to the customer. They'll get a notification and can approve or reject it. Keep shopping while you wait for their response."

**[SCENE 5: Completing Order - 45 sec]**
"You've found everything! Review your cart one more time. Count your bags. Organize them - cold items together in insulated bags, fragile items on top, heavy on bottom. Tap 'Complete Shopping'. Good job! Now stage it in the pickup area with the order number tag, and you're done. The driver will take it from here."

**[OUTRO - 20 sec]**
"That's how you shop an order! With practice, you'll get faster and faster. Focus on quality, communicate with customers, and you'll be a top-rated shopper in no time. Now go shop!"

If you have multiple orders, keep them completely separate and label them. Tap 'Picked Up' in the app."

**[SCENE 3: Navigation & Communication - 45 sec]**
"Follow the navigation to the delivery address. Drive safely - obey all traffic laws. If you're running more than 10 minutes late, message the customer with an update. If you can't find the address, call them. Communication is key to great service."

"You've arrived! Park legally. Grab all the bags for this order. Ring the bell or knock. When the customer comes to the door, greet them: 'Hi! Tulemar Shop delivery for [Name]'. Hand them the bags.

"Welcome to the concierge team! You're the problem solver, the communicator, and the quality guardian. Let me show you how to ensure every customer has an amazing experience."

**[SCENE 1: Dashboard Tour - 45 sec]**
"This is your command center. At the top, you see all active orders and key metrics. The 'Needs Attention' tab shows orders with issues - these are your priority. The message panel shows unread customer and team messages. You'll spend most of your time here, monitoring everything and jumping in when needed."

**[SCENE 2: Monitoring Orders - 60 sec]**
"Let's proactively monitor. This order has been in 'Assigned' status for 15 minutes - that's too long. Click on it. I can see the shopper hasn't started yet. Let me message them: 'Hi, just checking in on order #1234. Are you able to start shopping soon?' There we go. This is proactive service - catching problems before they become complaints."

**[SCENE 3: Handling Customer Messages - 60 sec]**
"You have an unread message. This customer is asking about a delay. Response time is critical - you have less than 2 minutes. Let me check the order status... the shopper is dealing with multiple out of stock items. I'll message the customer: 'Hi Sarah, I wanted to personally update you. Your shopper is carefully selecting your items but several products are temporarily unavailable. We're suggesting great alternatives and will have your order to you within 30 minutes. Thank you for your patience!' Always acknowledge, explain, and give a timeline."

**[SCENE 4: Approving Substitutions - 45 sec]**
"Here's a substitution request from a shopper. The customer ordered organic strawberries but they're out. The shopper is suggesting regular strawberries at a lower price. Let me check the customer's profile - no special dietary needs noted. This looks good. I'll approve it and add a note: 'Good substitution - similar product, lower price.' Always review substitutions for quality and appropriateness."

**[SCENE 5: Resolving Issues - 60 sec]**
"Uh oh, this customer says they're missing an item from their delivery. This is urgent. Let me review the order... I can see the item was marked as found by the shopper. I'll message the customer: 'I sincerely apologize! Let me make this right immediately. I'm issuing a full refund for the missing item and adding a $10 credit to your account. We value your business!' Then I'll follow up with the shopper and driver to understand what happened."

**[OUTRO - 15 sec]**
"Remember: respond fast, communicate clearly, solve problems generously, and always follow up. You're the voice of Tulemar Shop - make every interaction count!"

## Video 5: Store Manager - Leading Your Team (5 min)

"Welcome, Store Manager! You're leading the team that makes Tulemar Shop run smoothly. Let me show you how to manage operations effectively."

**[SCENE 1: Dashboard & Metrics - 60 sec]**
"Your dashboard is mission control. At the top, today's key metrics: revenue, orders completed, active orders, and customer satisfaction. Below that, you see all orders color-coded by urgency, your team members and their current assignments, and alerts that need your attention. Let's focus on these alerts - they're prioritized by severity."

**[SCENE 2: Team Management - 60 sec]**
"Click on 'Team' to see everyone working today. You can see their real-time status, current assignments, and today's performance. This shopper has a 98% find rate - excellent! This driver is on their third delivery in an hour - right on target. If someone needs help, you can reassign orders, send support, or jump in to assist."

**[SCENE 3: Order Assignment - 60 sec]**
"A new order just came in. The system suggests assigning it to Maria - she's nearby and has capacity. But I notice this is a VIP customer with a large order. Instead, I'll assign it to James, our most experienced shopper. Click the order, select 'Assign to', choose James, add a note: 'VIP customer, prioritize quality', and confirm. James gets the notification immediately."

**[SCENE 4: Handling Issues - 75 sec]**
"This alert shows an order that's been shopping for 90 minutes - way too long. Let me investigate. I'll check in with the shopper... they're new and struggling with the store layout. I can either send help or reassign. I'll message our concierge: 'Can you support Sarah with order #5678? She's a new shopper and could use guidance.' Now I'll message Sarah directly: 'Hey Sarah, I see you're working hard on this order. I've asked our concierge to help you out. Don't hesitate to ask questions!' That's hands-on management."

**[SCENE 5: Performance Review - 45 sec]**
"At the end of your shift, review performance. Click 'Analytics'. You can see today vs targets, individual performance, customer feedback, and trends. This data helps you coach your team, identify training needs, and make improvements. Export reports to share with leadership."

**[OUTRO - 20 sec]**
"Great managers build great teams. Monitor actively, support proactively, coach consistently, and celebrate wins. Your team is counting on you - lead them to success!"
